## 👋 About Me

I’m a frontend developer with five years of experience building complex web applications. I have strong expertise in designing frontend architecture, implementing scalable solutions, and maintaining clean, type-safe code. I’m well-versed in modern frameworks and libraries, work confidently with Figma, and participate in the full development cycle. I’m also familiar with CI/CD processes and can take on part of the responsibilities typically handled by other roles when needed, ensuring smooth collaboration and delivery.
  
I have extensive experience working in teams ranging from 2 to 23 people, contributing not only as a developer but also through technical leadership, code reviews, and mentoring. I’m skilled in performance optimization and UX improvement, always striving to balance technical quality with user convenience. My goal is to build stable, scalable, and intuitive interfaces that deliver real value to both businesses and users.
